It is better to travel alone. There is no companionship with a fool. Go
on your way alone and commit no evil, without cares like a great
elephant in the deep forest.

It is good to have companions when occasion arises, and it is good to be
contented with whatever comes. Merit is good at the close of life, and
the elimination of all suffering is good.

                                           â€” Dhammapada, verses 330, 331
